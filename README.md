To run the code simply open up the main.ipynb file, install the missing packages and run all the cells in order.

You can change the path to the image selected to experiment with different images in the folder. The image that I used to obtain my result is test1.

The code will take hours to finish. It is strongly recommended that you run the code on platforms such as google colab so that it does not take up too much resources for your computer.

Thank you!
